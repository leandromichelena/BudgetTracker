## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 19. <br>
Most of the code for this application was provided by the University of Toronto. This challenge consisted of creating a progressive web app PWA and prepare the database for offline functionality. This was done by creating an indexed database file, a service worker and a manifest file. The manifest file provides the mobile device with the information necessary to display the page as an app in the users home-screen. The idb file provides methods for caching and updating the database entries when the connection to the internet is restablished. And finaly the service-worker file provides the information about which files are needed for caching purposes and updates these files as needed.
